## NWB:N 2.0 beta (11/10/2017, Complete) <a id="nwb2-beta-plan"></a>

This is a first public beta release of the new version NWB:N. The intent of this beta release is to enable early adopters to start exploring the new format and software. As development is ongoing, there may still be bugs and further changes to the APIs as well as the format are still planed between this beta and the first full release of NWB:N2.0. As such backward compatibility cannot be promised at this point yet.


### New features for this release:

* **PyNWB:** A new advanced python API for the new version of NWB:N 2.0. PyNWB defines a new modular software architecture and API to enable users/developers to efficiently interact with the NWB:N data format, format files, and specifications. The new software architecture  decouples the various aspects of NWB:N (i.e. the specification language, format specification, storage, and API) to allow each to be used and maintained more independently. PyNWB also provides and API for interacting with NWB:N format specifications and provides mechanisms to easily create and use format extensions.

    * **Available online:** [https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb)

    * **Documentation:** <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pynwb">PyNWB : Python Reference API Docs</a>

    * **Supported Languages** :
        * Python >2.7.x
        * Python >3.6.x

    * **Core features**:

        * Write NWB:N HDF5 files
        * Read NWB:N files (base round-trip read/write)
        * Validate NWB:N files
        * Create new format extensions
        * Read/Write data using extensions
        * Read legacy NWB:N1.0x files from the Allen Institute for Brain Science

    * **Main contributors for this release** :

        * Andrew Tritt, Oliver Ruebel, David Camp, Kris Bouchard (LBNL) : Lead architects and development team
        * Nicholas Cain (Allen Institute for Brain Science) and Andrew Tritt (LBNL) : Port to Python 2 and legacy read for Allen data
        * Bug fixes, feedback and suggestions have also been contributed by numerous users and developers from the NWB:N community.
          For details see [https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/graphs/contributors)

* **PyNWB testing, continuous integration, deployment** We have developed an extensive set of unit tests for PyNWB. We have also created base infrastructure for integration tests to test end-to-end read/write of NWB:N files and data objects. While coverage of the tests is already quite good (>80%) coverage of the integration test suite is expected to be incomplete. We have also setup infrastructure for continuous integration to execute all tests on a broad range of platforms as well as defined software deployment paths (e.g., via PIP, CONDA)

    * **Available online:** For an overview of the various software health checks and tests being perfomed regulalary on PyNWB, see [https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb)

    * **Continuous integration** :

        * CircleCI (Linux, py27, py36)
        * Travis (MacOS, py27, py36)
        * AppVeyor (Windows, py27, py36)
        * Codecov.io
        * PEP8Speaks

    * **Deployment**:
        * PIP (PyPI)
        * Conda (CondaCloud)

    * **Main contributors for this release**

        * Andrew Tritt (LBNL) : Lead for design and implementation of the Python test suites
        * Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin, Doruk Ozturk, Chris Kotfila, Michael Grauer, Will Schroeder (Kitware) : Lead development team for creation of continuous integration, testing, and deployment mechanisms. For details see [https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/graphs/contributors)


* **Specification Language** We have simplified and extended the specification language used to describe the NWB:N format to ease readability, interpretability and expressiveness as well as added support for compound data types and references among others.

    * **Documentation:** <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/schemalanguage"> Specification Language Docs</a>. The
      documentation also includes the **release notes** describing the changes in NWB:N 2 beta.

    * **Main contributors for this release** :

        * Andrew Tritt, Oliver Ruebel, Kris Bouchard (LBNL) : Development leads
        * Changes to the specification language have also been reviewed and new changes have been proposed at a community hackathon at Janelia Farms HHMI in August 2017. Many users have also contributed via GitHub issues.


* **Data Standard Specification** Changes to the format have focused mainly on improving the structure and usability of NWB:N rather than adding new features to the format itself. Updates to the NWB:N format include among others: 1) extensions to clarify and extend the concept of NWBContainer (previously Interface), 2) avoid implicit links, 3)  improve consistency and ease-of-use, 4) refactor of ``/general/extracellular_ephys`` and ``ElectrodeGroup`` to use data tables via compound data types.

    * **Available online:** nwb-schema is available on GitHub at https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-schema

    * **Documentation:** <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/datastandard">Data Standard Schema Docs</a>.The
      documentation also includes the **release notes** describing the changes in NWB:N 2 beta.

    * **Main contributors for this release** :

        * Andrew Tritt, Oliver Ruebel (LBNL) : Implementation and documentation leads
        * Changes to the format specification have also been reviewed and new changes have been proposed at a community hackathon at Janelia Farms HHMI in August 2017. Many users have also contributed via GitHub issues.


* **Documentation** We have created dedicated online documentations for the various aspects of NWB:N. While the documents are quite extensive, completeness and consistency of the documents is not guaranteed for the beta release and examples, tutorials and release notes (i.e., changes), may be a bit out of date given pace of development.

    * **Available online**:
        * <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/overview">Project Overview</a>
        * <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pynwb">PyNWB : Python Reference API</a>
        * <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/datastandard">Data Standard Schema</a>
        * <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/schemalanguage"> Specification Language</a>
        * <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/storage_hdf">Data Storage Specification: HDF5</a>

    * **Format Documentation Tools** To ensure consistency between the NWB:N format specification and documentation we have developed a set of tools that generate Sphinx RST documents from the YAML specification sources. The tools are available in Python 2/3 as part of the <a href="https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-docutils"  target="_blank">NWB:N Documentation Utilities</a>.

    * **Main contributors for this release** :
        * Oliver Ruebel and Andrew Tritt (LBNL) : Documentation leads
        * Several of the documents have been ported from NWB:N 1.x, which were originally created by Jeff Teeters (UCB) et al.
        * Other teams have also contributed bug fixes

* **MatNWB** MatNWB is a Matlab API for NWB:N. MatNWB generates Matlab classes for representing NWB:N neurodata_type directly from the YAML specification.

    * **Core features**:

        * Write NWB:N HDF5 files
        * Read NWB:N HDF5 files
        * Read/Write data for custom extensions

    * **Main contributors for this release:**
        * Nathan Clack and Lawrence Niu (Vidriotech) : Software design and development lead
        * Karel Svoboda  (Janelia Farms HHMI): Project Lead
        * Andrew Tritt and Oliver Ruebel : Review and discussion

# NWB:N 2.x : Development Plan  (xx 2019, Future)

NWB:N 2.x refers to the next major feature release of NWB:N beyond the main release of NWB:N 2. The features to be included and target release date for NWB:N 2.x will be decided on after the NWB:N 2.0 release is complete. On GitHub we are using the milestones *NWB:N 2.x* and *Future* to organize these issues.

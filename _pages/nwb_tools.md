# Analysis and Visualization Tools for NWB:N

### Disclaimer
This is a list of tools we are cataloging as a convenience reference for NWB:N users. This 
is not a comprehensive list of NWB:N tools. Many of these tools are built and supported by
other groups, and are in active development. Their presence on this list is not an endorsement 
by the development team.

## [Brainstorm](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction)
Brainstorm is a collaborative, open-source application dedicated to the analysis of brain recordings: 
MEG, EEG, fNIRS, ECoG, depth electrodes and animal invasive neurophysiology built in Matlab. With the
help of Brainstorm developers, we have importers from NWB:N into the Brainstorm analysis suite for 
ECoG and invasive electrophysiology data.

## [NWBwidgets](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-jupyter-widgets)
NWBwidgets is a library for visualizing the structure and data of an NWB file in a Jupyter notebook.

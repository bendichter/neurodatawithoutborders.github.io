# !!!NEWS!!!

**Jan. 18, 2019:** We are excited to announce the full release of Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology version 2.0 (NWB:N 2.0). NWB:N is a data standard for neurophysiology, providing neuroscientists with a common standard to share, archive, use, and build common analysis tools for neurophysiology data. With NWB:N 2.0 we have made significant advances towards creating a usable standard, software ecosystem, and vibrant community for standardizing neurophysiology data. With [PyNWB](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/pynwb) and [MatNWB](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/matnwbemb) this release also includes advanced NWB:N-compliant data APIs for both Python and Matlab. For further details please see our [full news release](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/news).

# Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiolgy (NWB:N)

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology ("NWB:N") data standard is designed to store a variety of neurophysiology data, including from intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology experiments, optical physiology experiments, as well as tracking and stimulus data.

This page is used to collect and organize materials around the NWB:N data standard and ecosystem. For a more broader overview
of the NeurodataWithoutBorders project at large see also the <a href="https://www.nwb.org/">nwb.org</a> website.

## NWB:N -- An Ecosystem for Neuroscience Data Standardization

NWB:N is more than just a file format but it defines an ecosystem of tools, methods, and standards for
storing, sharing, and analyzing complex neurophysiology data. For more details see the [Project Overview](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/overview).

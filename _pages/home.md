# Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiolgy (NWB:N)

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology ("NWB:N") data standard is designed to store a variety of neurophysiology data, including from intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology experiments, optical physiology experiments, as well as tracking and stimulus data.

This page is used to collect and organize materials around the NWB:N data standard and ecosystem. For a more broader overview
of the NeurodataWithoutBorders project at large see also the <a href="https://www.nwb.org/">nwb.org</a> website.

We completed a first public **beta release** of NWB:N 2 in
November 2017 in conjunction with the Annual Society for Neuroscience Meeting (SfN). The intent of the **NWB:N 2 beta**
release was to enable early adopters to start exploring the new format and software. While development on NWB 2.0 has
been progressing rapidly, NWB:N 2 is under **active development**. That being said, this is a great starting point for
exploring NWB:N 2 and beginning adoption of the data standard. Development on the core standard has been progressing
rapidly and PyNWB provides a fully featured read and write API for NWB:N 2.

## NWB:N -- An Ecosystem for Neuroscience Data Standardization


NWB:N is more than just a file format but it defines an ecosystem of tools, methods, and standards for
storing, sharing, and analyzing complex neurophysiology data.

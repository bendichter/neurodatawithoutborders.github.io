# Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiolgy (NWB:N)

We completed a first public beta release of NWB:N 2 in November 2017 in conjunction with the Annual Society for Neuroscience Meeting (SfN). NWB:N 2 provides a fully featured read and write API for Python (PyNWB) and Matlab (matNWB). Although NWB:N 2 is under active development, this is a great time to start adoption of the data standard

The Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology ("NWB:N") data standard is designed to store a variety of neurophysiology data, including from intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology experiments, optical physiology experiments, as well as tracking and stimulus data.

This page is used to collect and organize materials around the NWB:N data standard and ecosystem. For a more broader overview
of the NeurodataWithoutBorders project at large see also the <a href="https://www.nwb.org/">nwb.org</a> website.

## NWB:N -- An Ecosystem for Neuroscience Data Standardization

NWB:N is more than just a file format but it defines an ecosystem of tools, methods, and standards for
storing, sharing, and analyzing complex neurophysiology data. For more details see the [Project Overview](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/overview).

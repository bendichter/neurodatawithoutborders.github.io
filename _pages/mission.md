# Mission

**Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB:N)** is a project to develop a
unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology data, focused on
the dynamics of groups of neurons measured under a large range of
experimental conditions. Participating labs provided use cases and
critical feedback to the effort. The design goals for the NWB format
included:

- Compatibility
    -  Cross-platform
    -  Support for tool makers
- Usability
    -  Quickly develop a basic understanding of an experiment and its data
    -  Review an experiment's details without programming knowledge
- Flexibility
    -  Accommodate an experiment's raw and processed data
    -  Encapsulate all of an experiment's data, or link to external data
       source when necessary
- Extensibility
    -  Accommodate future experimental paradigms without sacrificing
       backwards compatibility.
    -  Support custom extensions when the standard is lacking
- Longevity
    -  Data published in the format should be accessible for decades

# Events

## Hackathon Events

The NWB:N team consists of neuroscientists and software developers who recognize that creation and adoption of a unified data standard is an important step toward breaking down the barriers to data sharing in neuroscience. Hackathons are a way for us to collaborate and develop NWB:N as well as to engage with the NWB:N user community. NWB:N Hackathons are hands-on events lasting several days in which participants work collaboratively on solutions that use or expand the NWB:N data standardization ecosystem. For an overview of upcoming and past hackathons see <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/events/hackathons">here.</a>
